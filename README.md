-   ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-csharp-050B1E?&logo=csharp)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Project

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:jsam07/bag-it.git
```

### 2. Open in Visual Studio Preview 2022

In order to run the MAUI application locally, you'll need to install **the latest version of** Visual Studio Preview 2022 (.NET MAUI Preview 14) with the following workloads:
  - Mobile development with .NET 
  - Universal Windows Platform development 
  - Desktop development with C++ 
  - .NET Desktop Development 
  - NET and web development (required for Blazor Desktop and the BlazorWebView control)

*Note*: this is important since .NET MAUI is still in preview, breaking changes could occur if this is not done.

Once VS Preview is configured, you can run the app in `Debug mode`, using either one of the  pre-installed `Android Emulators` or `Windows Machine` option. See below.
